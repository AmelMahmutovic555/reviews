# reviews

The reviews project is a project that generates a detailed infromation about the person that is displayed currently on the website. When the user clicks the right arrow button he gets the detailed information of the person that is on the right side of the person that we have displayed currently, similiar thing happens when the user clicks the left arrow button the only difference is that it displays the person that is on the left side of the person that we have displayed currently. The Surprise Me button is a button that gives a detailed information of the person that is random generated by the website.
